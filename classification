Evaluation Model:
Evaluate the performance of each of these models. 
Accuracy is not enough, so you should also look at other performance metrics like 
Precision (measuring exactness), 
Recall (measuring completeness), 
the F1 Score (compromise between Precision and Recall).

Finding below these metrics formulas using confusion matrix
TP = # True Positives, 
TN = # True Negatives, 
FP = # False Positives, 
FN = # False Negatives.

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
F1 Score = 2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall)

1.GaussenNB:
TP = # True Positives = 55
TN = # True Negatives = 12 
FP = # False Positives = 91
FN = # False Negatives = 42

Accuracy = 0.335
Precision = 0.376
Recall = 0.567
F1 Score = 0.452

2.Decision tree
TP = # True Positives = 74
TN = # True Negatives = 35
FP = # False Positives = 68
FN = # False Negatives = 23

Accuracy = 0.545
Precision = 0.521
Recall = 0.762
F1 Score = 0.635

3.Random Forest
TP = # True Positives = 87
TN = # True Negatives = 10
FP = # False Positives = 57
FN = # False Negatives = 46

Accuracy = 0.485
Precision = 0.604
Recall = 0.604
F1 Score = 0.604

4.KNN
TP = # True Positives = 74
TN = # True Negatives = 23 
FP = # False Positives = 48
FN = # False Negatives = 55

Accuracy = 0.485
Precision = 0.606
Recall = 0.573
F1 Score = 0.589

5.Kernal SVM
TP = # True Positives = 90
TN = # True Negatives = 7 
FP = # False Positives = 57
FN = # False Negatives = 46

Accuracy = 0.485
Precision = 0.612
Recall = 0.661
F1 Score =0.6355
